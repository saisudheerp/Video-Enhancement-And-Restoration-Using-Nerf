## 1. Introduction

In today's world, healthcare apps play a crucial role in managing health records, booking appointments, and providing online consultations. This portfolio showcases various algorithmic solutions implemented in C and C++ to enhance functionalities within a healthcare app. I got the idea of healthcare apps from Practo. I have  done research about Practo and found out the functionalities that Practo is implementing. My idea is to make a health app that provides the functionalities of Practo and add some additional features that will improve the app and make the app efficient. This app will be useful for both doctors and patients.

This app not only facilitates easier access to healthcare services but also contributes to better health outcomes by providing timely medical advice, tracking health metrics, and maintaining health records. By using algorithmic problem-solving techniques, we can further improve  the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of these apps, ensuring they meet the evolving needs of users.

## 4. Design

The design of this portfolio involves selecting specific functionalities within a healthcare app and applying relevant algorithms to optimize their performance. Each functionality is paired with an appropriate algorithm and is demonstrated with C and C++ code examples. I have written some codes and some of them I have gathered from various internet resources. The following functionalities and algorithms are covered:

### 1. Doctor Search by Specialty

For searching doctors based on their specialty in a large dataset, a linear search is inefficient as it takes more time to search. The best approach would be using a Trie data structure, which allows for efficient prefix-based searching. Time Complexity and Space complexity are O(number of words * maxLengthOfWord). Here is my code for the [Trie data structure](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/trie.cpp)[1].

### 2. Appointment Scheduling

Efficiently manage appointment scheduling to optimize healthcare provider availability and patient convenience. Traditional methods may lead to inefficient scheduling and patient wait times. The best approach would be using the Min-Heap data structure, which allows for efficient retrieval and insertion of appointments based on priority, such as urgency or patient condition severity. Time Complexity is O(n*logn) and space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Min-Heap implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/min_heap.cpp)[2].

### 5. Emergency Response System

For providing quick access to emergency services based on location, simple routing methods are inefficient. The best approach would be using Dijkstra's Algorithm, which finds the shortest path in weighted graphs. Time Complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/dijkstras.c).

### 6. Medicine Availability

For checking the availability of medicines in various pharmacies, a linear search is impractical. The best approach would be using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all nearby pharmacies systematically. Time Complexity and Space complexity are O(n). Here is my code for [BFS](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/bst.c).

### 7. Patient Queue Management

For managing patient queues in clinics, a first-come-first-served approach may be inefficient because some patients should be treated based on emergencies. The best approach would be using a Priority Queue to handle patients based on urgency. Time Complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Priority Queue](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/priority_q.c).

### 8. Symptom Tracking Over Time

This use case  is to track changes in symptoms over time. A person experiencing normal leg pain might initially ignore it, but if the pain continues for several days, it could be a sign of a more serious condition like bone cancer. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the symptoms continuously at regular intervals. The best approach would be using the Sliding Window Algorithm to analyze data within specific intervals. Time Complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1). Here is my code for the [Sliding Window Algorithm](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/sliding_window.cpp)[4].

### 9. Insurance Claim Processing

Efficiently process insurance claims while minimizing processing time and maximizing accuracy. Traditional methods may struggle with the complexity and volume of claim data. The best approach would be using a Graph-based approach, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, to optimize the routing and processing of claims through the insurance network. Time Complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/dijkstras.c).

### 10. Healthcare Resource Allocation

Optimize the allocation of healthcare resources such as staff and equipment to meet patient demand efficiently. Simple heuristics may lead to suboptimal resource utilization. The best approach would be using a Max-Flow Min-Cut Algorithm, such as the Ford-Fulkerson method, to maximize resource allocation while minimizing costs and bottlenecks. Time Complexity is O(V * E^2) and space complexity is O(V). Here is my code for the [Ford-Fulkerson algorithm implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/ford_fulkerson.cpp)[5].

### 11. Electronic Health Record (EHR) Retrieval

Efficiently retrieve patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) from a large database. Basic search methods may be inefficient for large datasets. The best approach would be using an Indexing technique like B+ Tree, which allows for fast retrieval of records based on patient identifiers or timestamps. Time Complexity and Space complexity are O(logn). Here is my code for [B+ Tree implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/bplus.cpp)[6].

### 12. Medical Inventory Management

Manage and optimize the inventory of medical supplies and medications in hospitals or pharmacies. Simple inventory management methods like first-in, first-out (FIFO) may lead to overstocking or stockouts. The best approach would be using a Min-Heap data structure to prioritize and manage inventory levels based on demand and expiration dates. The time complexity is O(n*logn) and the space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for Min-Heap implementation. [Min-Heap implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/min_heap.cpp)[2].

### 13. Personalized Treatment Recommendation

Recommend personalized treatment plans for patients based on medical history and current conditions. Traditional methods may provide generic recommendations. The best approach would be using a Decision Support System, such as the A* Search Algorithm, which evaluates treatment options based on patient-specific factors like medical history, allergies, and genetic predispositions. Time Complexity is O(E*logn) and space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [A* Search Algorithm implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/Astar.cpp)[7].

### 14. Healthcare Facility Routing Optimization

This usecase is to optimize the routing of healthcare professionals within hospital facilities to minimize travel time and maximize patient care. The best approach would be using a Shortest Path algorithm like Dijkstra's Algorithm, which computes the most efficient routes based on dynamic factors such as patient locations and emergency situations. Time Complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/dijkstras.c) in facility routing.

### 15. Patient Discharge Planning

Optimize the discharge planning process for patients to ensure timely and smooth transitions from hospital care to home or rehabilitation facilities. Basic discharge planning methods like check list may lead to delays and inefficiencies. The best approach would be using a Graph Traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which identifies the shortest path and optimal sequence of discharge tasks based on patient needs and facility resources. Time Complexity and Space complexity are O(n). Here is my code for [BST implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/bst.c) in discharge planning.

### 16. Healthcare Supply Chain Optimization

Optimize the supply chain management of healthcare products and equipment to ensure timely availability and reduce costs. Traditional supply chain methods may lack visibility and responsiveness. The best approach would be using a Network Flow algorithm like the Ford-Fulkerson method, which maximizes the flow of supplies through the healthcare supply chain network while considering capacity constraints and demand fluctuations. Time Complexity is O(V * E^2) and space complexity is O(V). Here is my code for [Ford-Fulkerson algorithm implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/ford_fulkerson.cpp)[7].
